The University changed his policy of Degree Vote Computation. Now, the Degree vote is computed removing the '''two''' lowest positive vote and multiplying the obtained average for '''10/3'''. Negative vote are not considered in this calculation (as before). If the student has at least three '30 cum laude' then '0.5' is added to the degree vote. Pay attention the average is a Weighted arithmetic mean (see ComputeAverage).
