The University changed his policy. Now, a student can defend his/her thesis only if, he/she:

 * passed at least 10 exams (an exam is passed only if the vote is >= 18) and
 * the 'Total number of CFU' is >= 70 and
 * The value of the following formula (named F) is >= 3

The value of F is computed considering all the following cases:
If a student has a number of '30 cum laude' minor than 2 then F=F+1; if a student has a number of '30 cum laude' included between 2 and 4 then F=F+2; if a student has a number of '30 cum laude' > 5 then F=F+3. If a student has a number of '30 cum laude' equal to 5 then F=F+2.5.
If a student has passed the exams "DB" and "Software" then 10% of F is added to F, otherwise 5% is subtracted. 0.1 is added to F for each passed exam over the mandatory 10.
