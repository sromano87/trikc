A student can add a new exam to the register. An exam is composed of a name, CFU (i.e., a number that represent the university credit of the exam) and an optional vote. The name is unique, CFU is a positive number (>=0) and the vote, if inserted, is a number included between 0 and 30 (the vote can be also 0 or 30). A vote < 18 is negative (i.e., the exam is not passed) while >= 18 is positive (i.e., the exam is passed). An exam can be inserted also without the vote; it can be inserted later. 'Laude' can be added only when the vote is 30.
